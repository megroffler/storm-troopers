### Flight cancellation and delay prediction model using US flights and weather events

This is the repository for the Dev10 Cohort 40 Group Capstone Project. The project team consists of: Stephen Duval, David Perhai, Meghan Roffler, and Talia Willcott. In 2021, there were approximately 6.2 million passenger flights in the United States, with approximately 1 million flights delayed and 100k flights cancelled. Due to the inefficiency this causes, an ability to predict delays and cancellations has the potential to help airline operators minimize losses and passengers maximize ease of travel. This project will examine 2021 passenger flight data and 2021 weather events in order to find existing patterns and create predictions.
